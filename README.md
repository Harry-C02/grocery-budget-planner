This is my first python project. It is a simple tool to help with personal budgeting. It is currently scripted for grocery purchases but could easily be tweaked to accomodate a variety of budgeting needs. In its current stage, it depends on user input/discretion. 

I took what I learned today and improved on what I had. I learned how to use AI through Cursor to push what I initially made without AI. 

I had cursor make a web app out of the python3 grocery budget tool for fun.
